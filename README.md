# AutoSocial AI

AutoSocial AI is a Python automation project that helps you create social media posts or blog content based on your local development work. It watches a folder (like your codebase), detects updates, and generates content that can be posted to platforms like Twitter (X), LinkedIn, or your personal website.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. You give AutoSocial AI access to your project folder.  
2. It checks for updates or changes in the codebase.  
3. Based on the changes, it generates a post like:

   > Added login system using FastAPI + JWT. Working well! 🔐  
   > #FastAPI #Python #DevLog

4. It then posts this content to Twitter, LinkedIn, or your portfolio.
